#### 💎 Making Kotlin more Ruby-like
Ruby is a language "_optimized for programmer happiness_”. Kotlin is “_a modern programming language that makes developers happier_.”
As similar as these slogans sound, there are some striking differences between the two languages. This project aims to combine the best features of Ruby and Kotlin, and make Kotlin a little bit more Ruby-like.

[Kotlin Gems](https://mirianfonkam.github.io/kotlin-gems/) is a collection of Kotlin extensions that we wish were built into Kotlin's standard library.
